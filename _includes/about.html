		    <p style="font-size:25px;">I am a computational scientist with a strong focus on applied mathematics,
                machine learning, and computational fluid dynamics. My passion lies in solving complex problems
                and extracting insights from challenging datasetsâ€”whether through analytical "pen-and-paper"
                solutions, sophisticated computational algorithms, or an integration of both. Even more rewarding
                is when tackling these problems fosters collaboration and brings people together.</p>

		    <p style="font-size:25px;">My expertise spans programming, data analysis, developing and
                deploying end-to-end machine learning models, effective communication, and team leadership.
                Beyond work, I find joy in playing squash, spending quality time with my wife, supporting
                educational NGOs, and staying curious by exploring the latest scientific innovations.</p>
