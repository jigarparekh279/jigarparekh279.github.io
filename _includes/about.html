                <p style="font-size:25px;">I am a programmer specializing in applied mathematics, machine learning, and computational fluid dynamics. I love trying to make sense of difficult problems and datasets, be it through "pen-and-paper" analytic solutions or through complex computational algorithms (or both!). Even better, I love when said problems help bring people together.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size:25px;">My skills include programming, data analysis, implementation of end-to-end machine learning models, communication, and team leadership. Outside the workplace I thoroughly enjoy playing squash, spending time with my wife, helping educational NGOs, and learning about cool new scientific developments.
                </p>
