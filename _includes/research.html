                As a researcher in Sustainable and Energy-Efficient Aviation (SEÂ²A) Cluster of Excellence,
                I am currently developing algorithms for robust design optimization of airplane wings using
                scientific machine learning and Bayesian optimization. Being able to perform such optimization
                helps to design sustainable and energy efficient airplanes.

                I am one of the core developers of SMARTy (Surrogate Modeling for AeRo-data Toolbox in python)
                where I am mostly responsible for the development of Surrogate-Based Uncertainty Quantification and
                Optimization (SBUQ and SBO) modules. This toolbox is extensively used by DLR's academic and
                industrial partners.

                During my PhD, I worked on NWO funded project - development of uncertainty quantification approaches
                for wind turbine simulations incorporating various sources and types of uncertainties. Amid the AI
                hype, conducted a unique study, thoroughly comparing data-driven and physics-based methods for wind
                energy applications.

                Through my research and its open-source products, I aim to reduce the high barrier of entry related
                to the implementation, sharing, and proliferation of complex computational models.
