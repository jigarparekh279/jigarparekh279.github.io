                As a researcher in the Sustainable and Energy-Efficient Aviation (SEÂ²A) Cluster of Excellence,
                I am currently developing advanced algorithms for robust design optimization of airplane wings
                using scientific machine learning and Bayesian optimization. These methods enable the design of
                more sustainable and energy-efficient aircraft, contributing to greener aviation technology.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
                I serve as one of the core developers of SMARTy (Surrogate Modeling for AeRo-data Toolbox in
                Python), where I lead the development of the Surrogate-Based Uncertainty Quantification (SBUQ)
                and Surrogate-Based Optimization (SBO) modules. This toolbox plays a pivotal role in research
                and development efforts, being widely adopted by DLR's academic and industrial collaborators.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
                During my PhD, I contributed to an NWO-funded project focused on developing uncertainty
                quantification methodologies for wind turbine simulations, accounting for various sources and
                types of uncertainty. Amid the surge in AI-driven research, I conducted a distinctive study that
                rigorously compared data-driven approaches with physics-based methods for wind energy applications,
                offering valuable insights into their respective strengths and limitations.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
                Through my research and open-source contributions, I aim to lower the barriers to entry for the
                implementation, dissemination, and adoption of complex computational models, fostering innovation
                and collaboration in scientific and engineering communities.</p>
