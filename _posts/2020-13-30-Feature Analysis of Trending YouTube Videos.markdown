TLDR: In this project I used LDA and several type of classifiers in order to identify the features that can predict if a YouTube video will go into the trending page of a particular country. These features varied across different countries.
skills: Data Processing, Pattern Recognition, Language Processing, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Python, Pandas.
description: 'YouTube is the most popular video streaming platform on the planet. With about 2 billion monthly users spread across over 100 countries, it is fair to say that the themes and topics present in the trending videos of this platform are a good reflection of social trends at the national and global level. In this project we used latent feature analysis on data pertaining to YouTube trending videos in order to identify topics that describe the sociocultural similarities and differences between various countries. Furthermore, through the use of different classifier models, we identified which features are good predictors of a videoâ€™s future trendability across different nationalities. Furthermore, part of this effort was to identify if having fully capitalized words (i.e. NEW, OFFICIAL, ext...) in a video description is a good indication of future trendability. We concluded that it is not. Finally I summarize all these results by creating a hypothetical perfect trending video for each country such as to highlight the uniqueness of each nationality.'
