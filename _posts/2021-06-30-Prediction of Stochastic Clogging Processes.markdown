TLDR: In this project I used machine learning, computational fluid dynamics, and discrete element methods to predict stochastic clogging processes. The resulting Extremely Randomized Trees algorithm is able to predict clogging in unseen systems with a classification accuracy of 0.96.

description: 'The accumulation of discrete masses within constrained flow conduits is an common phenomenon within both natural and industrial settings: it describes the clogging of pipes, roads, oil reservoirs, rivers, and arteries. In this study we use Computational Fluid Mechanics and Discrete Element Models to run over 2,000 different clogging simulations in randomly-generated porous media in order to train and evaluate the clogging prediction performance of several Machine Learning algorithms. The resulting best-performing classifier (an Extremely Randomized Trees algorithm) is able to predict clogging a-priori with an accuracy of 0.96 and 0.91 in numerical and experimental systems, respectively. Similarly, the best performing regressor (also a decision tree-based algorithm) is able to achieve an R-squared value of 0.93 when predicting the degree of clogging in said systems. We believe this standardized computational tool has the potential to help evaluate the design process of engineered and natural porous media.'
