TLDR: In this project I used machine learning and computational fluid dynamics to make flow-field predictions around wind turbines under the presence of various sources of uncertainty. The resulting Extremely Randomized Trees algorithm is able to predict clogging in unseen systems with a classification accuracy of 0.96.
skills: Python, C++, OpenFOAM, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Numpy, Neural Networks, Regression.
description: 'Amid the AI hype, I conducted a unique study, thoroughly comparing data-driven and physics-based methods for wind energy applications. In this pursuit, I engineered a 3D U-Net CNN model, trained over 2TB of data from several wind turbine simulations, to effectively predict flow field in a wind farm, reducing the prediction time by 340x. Available as open-source.'
