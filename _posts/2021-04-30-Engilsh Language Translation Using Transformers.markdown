description: In this project, I implemented the transformer outlined in the landmark paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et. al., 2017 into TensorFlow for language translation from English to Portuguese. I programmed this particular model to show how the algorithm gradually learns and "understands" the languages in real time during training. I also made it possible to configure the transformer with differing amounts of encoder and decoder layers, making it a more flexible configuration.
