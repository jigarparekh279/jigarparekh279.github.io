description: 'Amid the AI hype, I conducted a unique study, thoroughly comparing data-driven and physics-based methods for wind energy applications. In this pursuit, I engineered a 3D U-Net CNN model, trained over 2TB of data from several wind turbine simulations, to effectively predict flow field in a wind farm, reducing the prediction time by 340x. Using this neural network and a wake-superposition model flow around entire wind farm was predicted with 97% accuracy. This combined approach (data + physics) enabled extremely fast propagation of environmental and operational uncertainties in wind farm simulations.'
