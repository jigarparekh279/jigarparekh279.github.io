TLDR: I created an open-source C++ codebase that can be used to simulate multiphase flow (i.e. water + air) through and around porous media at multiple scales (i.e. micrometers to meters). This first-of-its-kind model is free use and comes with several tutorial cases. 
skills:  C++, OPP, Bash, Partial Differential Equations, Vector Calculus, Asymptotic Matching, Fluid Dynamics, High-Performance Computing.
description: 'We propose a multiphase Darcy-Brinkman approach to simulate two-phase flow in hybrid systems containing both solid-free regions and porous matrices. This micro-continuum model is rooted in elementary physics and volume averaging principles, where a unique set of partial differential equations is used to represent flow in both regions and scales. The crux of the proposed model is that it tends asymptotically towards the Navier-Stokes volume-of-fluid approach in solid-free regions and towards the multiphase Darcy equations in porous regions. Unlike existing multiscale multiphase solvers, it can match analytical predictions of capillary, relative permeability, and gravitational effects at both the pore and Darcy scales. Through its open-source implementation, hybridPorousInterFoam, the proposed approach marks the extension of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation packages into porous multiscale, multiphase systems. The versatility of the solver is illustrated using applications to two-phase flow in a fractured porous matrix and wave interaction with a porous coastal barrier.'
