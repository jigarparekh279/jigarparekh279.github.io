TLDR: I fine-tuned the BERT transformer architecture to be able to identify positive and negative sentiment in online product reviews. The result is a classifier that can accurately infer the intent of each reviewer.
description: 'BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a novel neural network architecture developed by Google to capture the inter- and intra-sentence context within a text corpus. In this project, I built a classifier on top of said architecture in order to fine-tune the encoder weights within BERT and infer the encoded sentiment within online product reviews.'
