TLDR: Here I optimized the number of features needed to accurately classify Amazon customer reviews into positive reviews and negative reviews. The marginal increase in accuracy becomes negligible after sampling 202 different words.

description: 'The application of data science to sentiment analysis has become essential in the development of successful online products, be it in the areas of marketing (Google), entertainment (YouTube), retail (Amazon), and communication (Microsoft). Data science has allowed these sectors to monitor and influence consumer behavior, effectively changing the way that companies interact with their consumers. Direct contact is no longer strictly necessary, it is sufficient to analyze comments, web searches, messages, or product reviews to obtain the consumersâ€™ reaction to a new product or a change in services. In this project, I present an analysis of five different classifiers on a data set comprising of 3000 online reviews labeled as either positive and negative. I compare and contrast the classifiers ability to correctly predict a review label based on a bag of words representation and by taking into account the length of said reviews. Furthermore I studied the effects of feature selection (number of words sampled) on classifier performance. I conclude that the Logistic Regression classifier works best when compared to its counterparts, as it requires the least amount of features while obtaining the best performance in 4 out of 6 metrics. Finally, I conclude that review length is not a good predictor of sentiment.'
